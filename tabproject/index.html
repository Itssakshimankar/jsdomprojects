						<h4>History</h4>
						<p>Navgurukul was founded in 2016 by Abhishek Gupta and Rishabh Verma with a vision to provide quality education to underprivileged youth in India. Starting with a small group of students in a rented apartment, Navgurukul aimed to offer an alternative to traditional education by providing free, residential, and skill-based training in computer programming and software development. Over the years, Navgurukul has grown into a renowned institution, empowering hundreds of students from marginalized communities with the skills and opportunities to pursue successful careers in the tech industry.</p>
